# Component Name
DomainB2BInfoToGoogleSheet

# Description
This component is designed to process domain information in a B2B context and store the processed information in a Google Sheet. It is a part of the Yeager Workflow system and inherits from the AbstractWorkflow base class.

# Input and Output Models
- **Input Model**: DomainNameInputModel
    - domain (str): The domain name to be processed.

- **Output Model**: GoogleSheetOutputModel
    - sheet_url (str): The URL of the Google Sheet where the processed domain B2B information is stored.

Both input and output models use Pydantic's BaseModel for validation and serialization.

# Parameters
- **args** (DomainNameInputModel): The input data containing the domain to be processed.
- **callbacks** (typing.Any): Optional callbacks for extending the component functionality. Default value is None.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `transform()` method of the superclass (AbstractWorkflow) with the provided args and callbacks.
2. Extracts the resulting dictionary from the superclass transform() call.
3. Retrieves the sheet_url from the last item in the results_dict and creates a new GoogleSheetOutputModel instance with this sheet_url.
4. Returns the new GoogleSheetOutputModel instance.

# External Dependencies
- **dotenv**: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- **fastapi**: A Web API framework for building the component's API.
- **pydantic**: Provides data validation and serialization for input and output models.
- **core**: Contains the core Yeager Workflow logic, including the AbstractWorkflow base class.

# API Calls
No external API calls are made directly by this component. However, any API calls used by the superclass (AbstractWorkflow) will also be relevant here.

# Error Handling
The component does not handle errors directly. If any errors occur during the processing of the domain B2B information, they should be handled within either the superclass (AbstractWorkflow) or any relevant callback functions provided.

# Examples
Below is an example of how to use the DomainB2BInfoToGoogleSheet component in a Yeager Workflow:
