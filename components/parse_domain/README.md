# Component Name
ParseDomain

# Description
The ParseDomain component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow that extracts and returns B2B business information such as business name, contact information, and description from a provided domain URL. It utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries to make HTTP GET requests, parse HTML content, and extract the desired business information.

# Input and Output Models
## Input Model
class ParseDomainInputDict(BaseModel):
    domain: str

- `domain (str)`: The domain URL from which B2B business information will be extracted.

## Output Model
class ParseDomainOutputDict(BaseModel):
    extracted_data: List[Dict[str, str]]

- `extracted_data (List[Dict[str, str]])`: A list of dictionaries containing the extracted business name, contact information, and description for each B2B business found in the domain.

# Parameters
- `timeout (int)`: An integer value representing the specified number of seconds to wait before timing out while sending an HTTP GET request. This value is loaded from the component's configuration file.

# Transform Function
The `transform` function takes an input dictionary containing the domain URL and performs the following steps:

1. Validate the input domain URL.
2. Send an HTTP GET request to the input domain URL with the specified timeout using the requests library.
3. Parse the received HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
4. Identify HTML elements containing B2B business information like business name, contact information, and business description using a CSS selector.
5. Extract the information from the identified HTML elements.
6. Perform post-processing on the extracted information to present it in structured format.
7. Return the structured B2B information as output.

# External Dependencies
- `os`: Used to manage file system operations like opening the component configuration file.
- `requests`: Used to make HTTP GET requests.
- `BeautifulSoup (bs4)`: Used to parse and navigate HTML content.
- `FastAPI`: Used to create the API functionality for the component.
- `typing`: Provides types to define the input and output models.
- `pydantic`: Provides the BaseModel class for input and output data validation and serialization.
- `yaml`: Used to parse the component's configuration file.

# API Calls
The ParseDomain component sends an HTTP GET request to the input domain URL. It uses the `requests` library to make the request and set the timeout value as specified in the component's configuration.

# Error Handling
The component does not perform specific error handling within its code. However, errors caused by network issues, timeouts, or invalid input URLs may be raised by the `requests` library during the execution of the HTTP GET request. Errors during HTML parsing or content extraction might also be raised by the `BeautifulSoup` library.

# Examples
To use the ParseDomain component in a Yeager Workflow, you must first initiate the component, and then call the `transform` function with the required inputs. Remember to replace 'your_selector' in the source code with an actual CSS selector that identifies the B2B elements within the domain's HTML structure.
