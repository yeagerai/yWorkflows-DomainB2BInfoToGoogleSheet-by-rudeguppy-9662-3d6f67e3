# IdentifyIndustry

The IdentifyIndustry component uses a pretrained text classifier, such as DistilBERT, to determine the industry of the parsed domain based on the collected textual data. By analyzing the text data from a domain, it can classify the industry with high accuracy, leveraging the power of advanced natural language processing models.

## Initial generation prompt
description: The IdentifyIndustry component will use a pretrained text classifier
  like DistilBERT to determine the industry of the parsed domain based on the collected
  textual data.
name: IdentifyIndustry


## Transformer breakdown
- Load the pretrained text classifier model
- Preprocess the input text data
- Calculate industry probabilities with the model
- Determine the highest probability industry
- Check if the highest probability exceeds the threshold
- Return the predicted industry if it meets the threshold criteria, else return 'Unclassified'

## Parameters
[{'name': 'model_path', 'default_value': 'distilbert-base', 'description': 'Path to the pretrained text classifier model, such as DistilBERT.', 'type': 'str'}, {'name': 'threshold', 'default_value': 0.9, 'description': "The confidence threshold at which the model's prediction is considered reliable.", 'type': 'float'}]
